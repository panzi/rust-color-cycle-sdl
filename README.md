# A Color Cycle Viewer for the terminal

Color Cycling is a technique to render images with color palette based
animations. It was used in 90ies video games. This program renders such
images to Unicode capable ANSI terminals. Windows is not supported, but
I'd accept a pull request for that.

This implementation only supports a the background layer (no overlays)
and no time based events (for now, maybe I'll add that at some later time).

This viewer reads [Living Worlds Maker](https://magrathea.onrender.com/)
files (only the background layer) or JSON files similar to what the
[Canvas Cycle](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/canvas-cycle) demo
by Joseph Huckaby uses.

## Usage

```
Usage: color-cycle [OPTIONS] <PATH>...

Arguments:
  <PATH>...
          Path to a Canvas Cycle JSON file

Options:
  -f, --fps <FPS>
          Frames per second.

          Attempt to render in this number of frames per second. Actual FPS might be lower.

          [default: 25]

  -b, --blend
          Enable blend mode.

          This blends the animated color palette for smoother display.

  -o, --osd
          Enable On Screen Display.

          Displas messages when changing things like blend mode or FPS.


      --help-hotkeys
          Show list of hotkeys

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```
